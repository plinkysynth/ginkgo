but don't expect it to be usable by anyone (yet).

thanks:
much inspiration from https://garten.salat.dev/ and from the london live coding event i attended in august 2025.

3rd party components: libraries in 3rdparty/ are all public domain, as far as I know.

many thanks to the authors of these great libraries:

* stb_ds.h stretchy array and hash maps
* stb_image.h image loader
* miniaudio.h audio binding 
* sj.h json parser
* pffft.h fft implementation
